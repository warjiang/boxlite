//! Lock management for per-entity multiprocess-safe locking.
//!
//! This module provides a lock manager that allocates unique locks for entities
//! (boxes, volumes, etc.). Locks are identified by a numeric ID and can be
//! retrieved by that ID across process restarts.
//!
//! Two implementations are provided:
//! - [`InMemoryLockManager`]: Single-process locks for testing
//! - [`FileLockManager`]: Cross-process locks using flock(2)

/// Manager for allocating and retrieving multiprocess-safe locks.
///
/// Locks returned by a `LockManager` must be multiprocess-safe: allocating a lock
/// in process A and retrieving that lock's ID in process B must return handles
/// for the same underlying lock.
///
/// # Lock Lifecycle
///
/// 1. Call [`allocate`](LockManager::allocate) to get a new lock
/// 2. Store the [`LockId`] in persistent storage (e.g., database)
/// 3. Use [`retrieve`](LockManager::retrieve) to get the lock handle when needed
/// 4. Call [`free`](LockManager::free) when the entity is removed
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let manager = FileLockManager::new("/var/run/boxlite/locks", 1024)?;
///
/// // Allocate a lock for a new box
/// let lock_id = manager.allocate()?;
/// box_config.lock_id = lock_id;
/// save_to_database(&box_config);
///
/// // Later, retrieve the lock
/// let lock = manager.retrieve(lock_id)?;
/// lock.lock();
/// // ... critical section ...
/// lock.unlock();
///
/// // When box is removed
/// manager.free(lock_id)?;
/// ```
